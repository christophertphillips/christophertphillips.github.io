Hello! My name is Christopher Phillips, and I am a consultant working as a front-end web developer. During the last two years, I have developed web applications that focus primarily on data visualization. I am now interested in gaining exposure to a broader array of web development frameworks and technologies.

Please see my "Projects" page for more information and links to specific projects I've worked on, or "My Github" to go straight to my personal GitHub repository.

Thanks for stopping by!
