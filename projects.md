### Reporting Interface

![reporting-interface](../img/reporting-interface-intro.png)

This is a prototype version of a reporting interface that I expanded upon for a client project. It was designed to provide a highly-responsive and flexible reporting and visualization framework for social media data. It leverages libraries like D3.js, DC.js, Crossfilter, and Kendo UI. To access the respository and live demo, please [click here](https://github.com/christophertphillips/reporting-interface).

### Geographic Interface

![geographic-interface](../img/geographic-interface-intro.png)

This is a prototype version of a geographic interface that I expanded upon for a client project. It was designed to quickly plot interactions from social media data, and to provide a natural way of subsequently filtering the data (via zooming). It leverages libraries like Leaflet, Leaflet.markercluster, and Kendo UI. To access the respository and live demo, please [click here](https://github.com/christophertphillips/geographic-interface).
